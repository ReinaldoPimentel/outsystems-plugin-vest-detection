# Real Plugin Testing Options

## Option 1: Test in ODC (Recommended - Easiest)
Since you don't have Android SDK installed locally, this is the best option:

### Steps:
1. **Rebuild your mobile app in ODC** (with the updated plugin from GitHub)
2. **Download the APK** from ODC
3. **Install on Android device** via ADB or USB
4. **Check logs** with: `adb logcat | grep VestDetection`

You'll see the real debug logs from your plugin including:
- "loadModel: Starting model load"
- "Available assets: ..."
- "Model loaded, buffer size: ..."
- "Labels loaded: 2 items"
- Step-by-step detection logs

### What you'll get:
- ✅ **Real TensorFlow Lite model**
- ✅ **Real model loading from assets**
- ✅ **Real image processing**
- ✅ **Real vest detection**
- ✅ **Complete debug logs**

## Option 2: Install Android SDK Locally (For Advanced Debugging)
If you want to build and debug locally, you'd need:

```bash
# Install Android Studio (includes SDK and Gradle)
brew install --cask android-studio

# Set environment variables
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Build the app
cd VestDetectionTestApp
cordova build android
cordova run android
```

Then check logs with:
```bash
adb logcat | grep VestDetection
```

## Option 3: Quick Test with ADB (If Device Connected)
If you have an Android device connected:

```bash
# Check if device is connected
adb devices

# Monitor logs for your plugin
adb logcat | grep -i "vest"

# Run your ODC app on device
# Trigger vest detection
# See real-time logs
```

## My Recommendation:
**Use Option 1** - Rebuild in ODC and test on device. It's the fastest way to test the real plugin with all your debug logging!

The browser mock is ONLY for testing the UI/interaction flow, not the actual AI detection.
