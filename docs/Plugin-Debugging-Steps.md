# Solution: Plugin Updated with Enhanced Debugging

## ‚úÖ What I Just Did:

I added **comprehensive console logging** to your `VestDetection.js` file to help diagnose why the output variables are empty.

### Changes Made:
1. **Added logging** before calling `exec()`
2. **Added logging** in both success and error callbacks
3. **Added JSON.stringify** to log the actual result/error objects
4. **Pushed to GitHub**: Your ODC app will get the updated version

## üéØ Next Steps:

### Step 1: Update ODC App to Pull Latest Plugin
1. In ODC, your Extensibility Configuration should be:
   ```
   https://github.com/js7vensousa/outsystems-plugin-vest-detection.git#main
   ```
2. **Rebuild** your mobile app in ODC
3. **Install** the new build on device

### Step 2: Check Device Console Logs
After the rebuild, when you run `CheckVest`, you should see these logs in device console:

**If working correctly:**
```
VestDetection.detectBase64 called with image length: 12345
Calling exec with success callback: function
SUCCESS callback received
Result: {"label":"vest","confidence":0.95,...}
```

**If error occurs:**
```
VestDetection.detectBase64 called with image length: 12345
ERROR callback received
Error: {"error":"Model loading failed: ...",...}
```

### Step 3: Report What You See
Tell me what messages appear in the console logs. This will tell us EXACTLY where it's failing.

## üîç Possible Issues We're Looking For:

### Issue 1: Callback Never Receives Result
**Symptom**: No "SUCCESS callback received" or "ERROR callback received" messages
**Cause**: Java code is not calling callbackContext.success/error
**Solution**: Check Android logs for "Step 1", "Step 2", etc. messages

### Issue 2: Error Callback Fires
**Symptom**: "ERROR callback received" message appears
**Cause**: Something failing in the Java code
**Solution**: Error object will show which step failed

### Issue 3: Success Callback Fires But Result is Empty
**Symptom**: "SUCCESS callback received" but result is empty object
**Cause**: OutSystems variable mapping issue
**Solution**: Check that result object properties match OutSystems variable names

## üì± How to Check Device Logs:

### Android:
1. Enable USB debugging on device
2. Connect to computer
3. Open Chrome DevTools: `chrome://inspect`
4. Click "Inspect" on your app
5. Go to Console tab
6. Run your CheckVest action
7. Look for messages starting with "VestDetection"

### iOS:
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Safari ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí Your iPhone
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run CheckVest action
5. Look for VestDetection messages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Most Important:

After you rebuild the ODC app with the updated plugin and run CheckVest, **tell me exactly what messages appear in the device console**. This will pinpoint the exact problem!
