# Android Build Status and Options

## üîç Current Situation:

**You DON'T need Gradle locally** for OutSystems ODC development!

### Why not?

1. **ODC Handles Builds**: OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) handles all Android/iOS builds in their cloud
2. **You Only Need Code**: The plugin code (JavaScript and Java) is what gets uploaded
3. **ODC Downloads Plugin**: When you configure Extensibility Config, ODC downloads your plugin from GitHub
4. **ODC Compiles**: ODC uses Gradle internally to compile your plugin during the mobile app build

## üìä What You Need Locally:

### For Local Development:
- ‚úÖ **Browser Testing**: Plugin interface testing (current setup)
- ‚úÖ **Code Editing**: Edit JavaScript/Java files
- ‚úÖ **Git**: Push changes to GitHub
- ‚ùå **Android SDK**: NOT needed (ODC handles this)

### For Real Device Testing:
- ‚úÖ **ODC Build**: Upload code ‚Üí ODC builds APK/iOS app
- ‚úÖ **Install on Device**: Download from ODC
- ‚úÖ **Test**: Run on physical device

## üéØ The Real Issue:

Since the plugin isn‚Äôt working in your ODC app, the problem is likely:

1. **Code Issue**: Plugin code might have bugs
2. **Configuration Issue**: Extensibility Config might be wrong
3. **Mapping Issue**: OutSystems action might not be mapping variables correctly

## ‚úÖ What to Do Next:

### Option A: Test Locally (Current)
- Test in browser at http://localhost:8001
- Verify plugin interface works
- Check callback handling

### Option B: Push to ODC and Test
1. **Commit changes** to GitHub (already done)
2. **Rebuild** mobile app in ODC
3. **Install** on Android device
4. **Check device logs** for plugin messages

### Option C: Set Up Local Android SDK (Only if Needed)
If you want to test Android builds locally, you'd need:
```bash
# Install Android SDK and Gradle (NOT required for ODC)
# But if you want:
brew install --cask android-studio
# Then set ANDROID_HOME
# Then build with: cordova build android
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Most Important:

**You DON'T need to build locally for ODC!**

The Gradle compilation happens in ODC when you:
1. Publish the app
2. Generate mobile build
3. ODC compiles everything including your plugin

## üéØ Your Actual Next Step:

Since the plugin isn't working in ODC, we need to:

1. **Check your OutSystems CheckVest action** - How is it calling the plugin?
2. **Share the code** you're using in your OutSystems flow
3. **Test the simple test** I suggested earlier

The issue is likely in HOW you're calling the plugin in OutSystems, not in the plugin code itself!

**Please share:**
- How your CheckVest action is implemented
- Or tell me if you're using OutSystems auto-generated plugin actions
